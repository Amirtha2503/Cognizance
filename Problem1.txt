Problem 1
Write pseudocode and flowchart for a program that outputs ‘True’ if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘False’ otherwise, without using the ‘%’ operator explicitly (like N % 3 == 0).
NOTE: You can use ‘%’ operator to separate each digit of the given number(like N % 10).


Pseudo code: 
Method - 1


This program will allow the user to check if a number is divisible by 3


Step 1 : Input the number to be checked, let us assume that it is stored in a variable N


Step 2 : Initialize sum = 0


Step 3 : Check is sum of digits of N is either 0,3,6,9, to check if it is a multiple of 3


While N > 0


sum = sum + (N % 10)


If sum = 0 or sum = 3 or sum = 6 or sum = 9:
     Print response as "True"


Else:
    Print response as "False"

Method - 2


This program will allow the user to check if a number is divisible by 3


Step 1 : Input the number to be checked, let us assume that it is stored in a variable N


Step 2 : Initialize M = N/3


Step 3 :


If N - 3*M = 0:
Print response as "True"
Else:
Print response as "False"




Example:
If N = 26, 
M = 26/3 = 8.667
So N - 3*M will be -0.001, hence it will return false
But if N = 27, M = 9, and N - 3*M = 0, hence it will return True
