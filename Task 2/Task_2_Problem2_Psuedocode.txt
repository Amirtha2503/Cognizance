Problem 2 - Write pseudocode and flowchart for program that prints Nth fibonacci number. (Nth Fibonacci Number denoted as F(N), F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2,â€¦)


Pseudo code:


This program will allow the user to print the Nth Fibonacci number.


Step 1 : Input the value for which the Fibonacci number is printed, to a variable N


Step 2 : Make an empty list to store the numbers. Let us call it as L.


Step 3 : Initialize variables a = 0 and b = 1


Step 4 : Include the values of a, b to the list by appending them. 
(For example in python, L.append(a,b))


Step 5 : 
While N > 0
    For i in range 0 to N:
         c = a + b
         a = b
         b = c


Step 6 : Now append all the values of c to the list L.


Step 7 : Get the Fibonacci of the Nth number from the list.
(In python, it will be L[N] )


Example:
Let N = 6
a = 0, b = 1
And the list of Fibonacci numbers will be 
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
So the 6th Fibonacci number is 8 (L[6])
