# TASK 6
## This is a markdown file for the landing page created in Task 3
### Theme
The landing page was created for a *vegan backery* called ☘️***LEAF BAKED***🍞 to showcase their baked goodies and enable customers to purchase from the comfort of their homes! :)
### Motivation
```diff
+ There is a general misconception that vegan is bland (-_-).
+ So, this landing page was created to encourage people to try out vegan food without compromising on the taste. 
+ Leaf Baked specialises in making 🍰, 🎂, 🍪 and  🍕 by using vegan alternatives.
+ And this will also help lactose intolerant people to have yummy food without worrying about their health!!!
```
### Tools used
***Figma*** was used to create the landing page.
### Future enhancements
Some future scope for this landing page would be to:
```diff
!  Improve the quality of the landing page 
-  Add more features to it like coupon/lottery tickets and discounts for customers 
@@ Create an acutal website with a blog that details recipes @@
```
